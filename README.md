Hi, I am Aji a.k.a _IkalMan_. I am a profesional software engineer with
Backend as my primary focus.


I have some experiences in variety business industries, such as
property booking, ecommerce, and currently gaming industry (this is the one
that I have experiences the most).


Tech stack? Primarily Golang, but often jumping around Java as well. Devops
tech stack? k8s, Jenkins, Gitlab CI/CD Pipeline, AWS, that's all that I wanted
to tell You :) Just too much that I only had a chance to touch it once and
leave it once the task is done, lol.


On my spare time, I love to fly, repair and building a drone, fpv drone
to be exact. Checkout my youtube channel if you wanted to see some
